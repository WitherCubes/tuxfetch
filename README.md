# Tuxfetch
⚡⚡ A simple fetch program written in bash ⚡⚡

This is a very fast fetch program inspired from [pfetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pfetch) and [bfetch](https://gitlab.com/nautilor/bfetch/).

This script displays minimal system information with a [GameBoy ascii art](https://www.asciiart.eu/computers/game-consoles).

If you want to change the colors of Tuxfetch, you can use the [Unix color codes cheatsheet](https://github.com/ryanoasis/public-bash-scripts/blob/master/unix-color-codes.sh).

You can place this script anywhere and alias it in your .bashrc, .zshrc, or config.fish.
